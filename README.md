# AT&T Drive UI Framework

## UI Kit for AT&T Drive Platform
This AT&T Drive Automotive App development UI Kit is built to enable you -the developer, to effortlessly create apps to be deployed on AT&T Drive Automotive Services Delivery Platform.
At this time this is only an UI toolkit, with a goal to by 2015 include Drive Platform APIS and become an all-around SDK.

## Installation
