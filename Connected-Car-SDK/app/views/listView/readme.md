# List view

## Overview
The standard list menu, or primary list menu, is a simple means to provide a user with links or options to gain additional details.

## Appropriate Use
An appropriate use of the list menu would be to use it on a category page so that each list item would provide access to one of the available categories. Another use would be to provide access to the primary actions available for a given page, although Tabs are likely better option for toggling content within a single view.
