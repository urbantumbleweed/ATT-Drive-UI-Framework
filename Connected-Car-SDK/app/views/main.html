<h1>AT&amp;T Drive UI Kit</h1>
<p>This AT&amp;T Drive Automotive App development UI Kit is built to enable you -the developer, to effortlessly create apps to be deployed on AT&amp;T Drive Automotive Services Delivery Platform.</p> 
<h3>Building apps for Head Unit</h3>
App framework contains all the essentials to build standardized head unit apps, and starting your app from the sample apps is the fastest way to get started. Then take advantage of this site to visualize the UX, and get the example code. 

Now you are ready to build your first app, and the API is readily available. 

<h3>Seed your first app</h3>
<p>After installing the <a href="https://github.com/ericsson-innovate/ATT-Drive-UI-Framework">AT&amp;T Drive Head Unit SDK</a> locally, using terminal in "Connected-Car-SDK" folder run this command: <code>grunt seed --dec-host=127.0.0.1 --dec-port=4402 -name=/full/path/to/your/app</code> (you can change the default IP and port if needed). <br>You can always change ports and IP later (see optional commands in Setup.MD). 
	</p><p>
Once the build is completed the app will load in your browser and if you see the first page, the app is connected to span and ready for development. </p>
		<p>You can also start developing from the existing <a href="https://github.com/ericsson-innovate/sample-app">sample app</a>.

<h2>Voice as an app concept</h2>
    <p>AT&amp;T Drive is a cloud based automotive services delivery platform and the apps have the ability to be fully voice enabled as part of AT&amp;T initiative to prevent distracted driving. This document, including the design guidelines and the Information Architecture stencils are simplified to enable creation of automotive apps that are effortless and distraction-free.</p>

    <h3>Common source code, less clutter, faster apps, better experience</h3>
<p>The intent of this toolkit is to help automotive manufacturers maintain their brand presence in the in-car digital experience. As app developers build apps from the same framework of libraries and APIs, the result is structured, seamless, easy brand-able set of applications, and as AT&amp;T Drive offers theming per vehicle make/model/trim, reusing common UI libraries and app source-code is crucial.</p>
