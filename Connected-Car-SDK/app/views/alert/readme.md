# Alerts and notifications

##Overview
Notification dialogs function the same way as modals and overlay the entire screen, with action buttons fixed at the center of the screen. Dialog animations are predefined.

Tap launch dialog to see the animation. Dialogs may have a close button in the header and may rely on the challenge button requiring user action to dismiss them, or may contain timeout.
