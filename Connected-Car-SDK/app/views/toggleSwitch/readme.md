# Toggle switch

## Overview
The Toggle control allows the user to turn a setting on or off. (If you need a control that supports more than two options, consider a button group or radio buttons).

## Appropriate Use
Use a toggle for selections that become effective immediately when the user changes it. For example, a toggle may be used to turn On/Off Paperless Billing.

# Design Breakdown

## Placement
Toggles should typically be presented in list format with the control right-justified with a left-justified label on the same horizontal plane. They may or may not be bordered with a separator above or below depending upon the layout requirements.

## Size
Fixed

## Content
The toggle is limited to Yes/No (si/no) or On/Off. Spanish uses the I/O symbolic representation of On/Off with disabled states of activo/inactivo. No other labels should be used other than those shown above.

## Interactions
Interaction of a toggle should respond immediately to tapping or sliding.
