# Loader

Show busy/loading indicators on any element during $http requests (or any promise).

This library depends on Andy Joslin's angular-promise-tracker.
Annotate an $http request using `angular-promise-tracker` and add `cg-busy` on an element to display a busy indication on a specific element during the $http request.

This library builds on Angular 1.2 and the new Angular animate module in animate.js.
Supports IE 10, and recent versions of FF and Chrome.
